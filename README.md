# Portainer Compose Repo

Services I like to use on my personal home server.

## Getting Started

Use standard Docker Compose commands from this directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
docker compose logs -f caddy
```

`docker-compose.yml` includes all `*-compose.yml` stack files, so no wrapper script is required.
